# Bop-It-Style-Game
## Overview
This is the final project I and a teammate created for the University of California, Riverside class: EE128 Actuation and Sensing in Embedded Systems. This project uses the FRDM K64F development board and Arduino Uno R3 to create a Bop-It like game. The system consists of the two boards, potentiometer, button, joystick, and the accelerometer on the FRDM K64F. The user follows instructions on the LCD screen displayed using the Arduino Uno. The user then interacts with the sensors and K64F board in order to complete any actions stated within a set time. At the end of ten actions, the LCD screen outputs the user's score.

## Personal Contributions
Within this project, I designed and implemented the main.c code for the FRDM K64F, as well as debugged the Arduino code for it to properly interface with the LCD screen and receive SPI messages from the FRDM board. Skills and serial communication protocols I used within this project are: finite state machine design, C/C++ coding, bit manipulation, GPIO input, analog to digital conversion (ADC), I2C, SPI, and UART.
